The tutorial within this folder covers the first steps of the GOOGA pipeline and is designed to create a linkage map from a SNP dataset with lots of missing data or genotyping error. Specifically, this tutorial begins with a rQTL input file (.csv), conducts some basic filtering of the dataset, calculates genotype error rates and interscaffold recombination rates, iteratively removes poorly performing markers and individuals with too much genotyping error to create a polished linkage map, and uses the previous information to calculate posterior probabilities of genotypes for all individuals.

The folder below contains all input files, all scripts, and all intermediate files for this example. There are definitely more efficient ways to implement this series of programs – feel free to contact the authors with your improvements or questions (Nic Kooyers – nkooyers@gmail.com; John Kelly - jkk@ku.edu)! 

This tutorial does not cover the last step of GOOGA, the genetic algorithm used to order scaffolds on each linkage group. The dataset used in this tutorial was aligned to a genome where scaffolds were already assembled into chromosomes (with some clear problems). For an excellent tutorial on the last step of GOOGA, please go back to the home folder and enter the folder ‘Genetic Algorithm’.
